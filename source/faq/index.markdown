**Q: What if I can't finish the row?**

In case of an emergency, we will have two chase boats shadowing the rowers. Each of us must carefully and honestly assess the conditions and our own abilities before attempting the row - the expectation is that everyone who leaves the dock must be able to complete the entire Rally unless a true emergency arises.

**Q: What should I wear?**

For the row, we strongly recommend a brightly colored t-shirt or athletic shirt and hat. No earth tones or greys - we really want to stand out in traffic!

For the ride, you may want to pack a change of clothes - dry shorts and a top to go with your socks and bike shoes - and of course your helmet. Nobody rides without a helmet.

**Q: What should I bring with me?**

For the row (in a drybag):

- Cell phone
- VHF radio (if you have one)
- PFD
- Whistle
- Water
- Snacks

For the ride (in a small duffel or backpack, which will go up and back with Bertha):

- Cell phone
- Helmet
- Bike shoes and socks
- Cash for ice cream at Captain Dusty's
- Change of clothes (if needed)
- Water
- Lunch
- Bike supplies (spare tube, multi-tool, pump, etc.)

** Q: What VHF channel(s) will we use?**

Please monitor CH 9 for hailing then use CH 71 or 72 if you need to have a conversation.

**Q: What's for dinner?**

Good stuff. And rum.
